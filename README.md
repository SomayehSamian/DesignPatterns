## Introduction

This project aims to educate and familiarize developers with well-known design patterns in software development using C#. Each design pattern is provided with brief explanations and code examples to help developers utilize these patterns in their projects.

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are categorized into three main types:

- **Creational Patterns:** Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
- **Structural Patterns:** Deal with object composition or the way to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.
- **Behavioral Patterns:** Deal with communication between objects and how they interact and communicate with each other.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you need to have Git and .NET SDK installed.

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SomayehSamian/DesignPatterns.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd DesignPatterns.git
    ```

3. Restore dependencies:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

## Usage

To run any design pattern example, navigate to the respective directory and execute the code. For example:

```bash
cd Singleton
dotnet run
```
